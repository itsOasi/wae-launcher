# WAE Launcher

Get your WAE server up and running with minimum effort. WAE Launcher is a Docker Container for deploying your WAE projects

## How it works

1. Tweak the ```wae_config``` file to your needs
2. Build Docker image
3. Launch it with Linode or AWS!

Once deployed, WAE will launch itself and clone your project
