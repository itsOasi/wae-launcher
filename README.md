# WAE Launcher

Get your WAE server up and running with minimum effort. WAE Launcher is a Docker Container for deploying your WAE projects

## How it works

1. Clone the latest version of WAE into a ```wae``` folder next to the ```Dockerfile```
2. Tweak the ```wae_config``` file to your needs
3. Build Docker image
4. Launch it with Linode or AWS!

Once deployed, WAE will launch itself and clone your project
