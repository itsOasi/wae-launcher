# WAE Launcher

Get your WAE server up and running with minimum effort. WAE Launcher is a Docker Container for deploying your flask api projects

## How it works

1. Tweak the ```wae_config``` file to your needs, namely pointing it to your directory
2. Build Docker image
3. Launch it with Linode or AWS!

Once deployed, WAE will launch itself and clone your project
