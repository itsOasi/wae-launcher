# WAE Launcher

Get your WAE server up and running with minimum effort. WAE Launcher is a Docker Container for deploying your flask api projects

## How it works

1. Clone this repo (or use it as template)
2. Tweak the ```wae_config``` file to your needs, namely pointing it to your directory
3. Add flask endpoints to perform functions
5. Deploy it with GCP, AWS, or any container service!

Once deployed, WAE will launch itself and clone your project
